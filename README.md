# Introduction

In this repository is a collection of packages that were written to satisfy weekly assignments in my CSCI 260 - Data Structures class. They are fairly old code, but each of them received full marks and extra as the programming challenges were also tackled (also available in the package).

The details as to what assignments were to what have been lost to me, but they should be fairly self explanatory. I will work on reverse engineering the assignment prompts when I can so that it's potentially useful to whoeever may come across this repo.

# The goal

Most of the assignments' goal were the same, they were to make us more familiar with the various data structures (LinkedList, ArrayList, etc) and implement the most appropriate ones. We were told to take note of what the advantages and disadvantages are, and keep that in mind as we choose what we think are the right types.
